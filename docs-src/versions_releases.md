# Versions & releases

This project uses semantic versioning and maintains a `development` branch for the current major (v3) and a `dev-v2` branch for critical fixes to the v2 line. See [DEVELOPER.md](DEVELOPER.md) for the full release process and branch policies.

## Quick pointers:

- Target `development` as the base branch for v3 feature PRs.
- Target `dev-v2` for v2 patches and critical fixes.

For a fuller developer-focused guide (setup, hooks, release steps and troubleshooting) see [DEVELOPER.md](DEVELOPER.md).
