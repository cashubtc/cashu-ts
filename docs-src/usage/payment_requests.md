# Payment Requests (NUT-18 / NUT-26)

A **payment request** lets a receiver describe a payment they want to be paid, encode it (as a string or QR), and hand it to a sender. The sender decodes it, builds a matching token, and delivers it over the transport the request specifies. See [NUT-18][nut18] and its Bech32m encoding [NUT-26][nut26].

Two encodings are supported and both decode through the same API:

- `creqA…`: CBOR + base64url (NUT-18)
- `CREQB1…`: TLV + Bech32m, more compact and QR-friendly (NUT-26)

## Decode an incoming request (sender side)

```typescript
import { decodePaymentRequest } from '@cashu/cashu-ts';

const pr = decodePaymentRequest(scanned); // accepts creqA… or CREQB1…

pr.amount; // requested Amount (undefined = payer chooses the amount)
pr.unit; // e.g. 'sat'
pr.description; // human-readable, show to the user
pr.mints; // mints the receiver accepts (string[] | undefined)
pr.getTransport('nostr'); // the transport of a given type, if present
```

## Which mint may I pay from?

A request may carry a mint list that is either **strict** (send only from these mints) or **preferred** (prefer these, but others are allowed). `isMintListStrict` resolves the NUT-18 default-to-strict semantic so you do not have to:

```typescript
// undefined = no list (any mint); true = strict; false = preferred/advisory
const allowed = !pr.isMintListStrict || pr.mints?.includes(myMint);
```

If `supportedMethods` (`sm`) is set, the sending mint must also support at least one of those methods (`bolt11`, `bolt12`, `onchain`, …). Checking that requires the sending mint's capabilities. See [Inspect Mint Capabilities](./mint_capabilities.md).

## How much do I send, including fees?

Each supported method can carry a fee (`mf`) that compensates the receiver for melting out via it. The fee applies only when paying from a mint outside the request's mint list (or from any mint if no list is set); a payment from a listed mint carries none. When one applies, the payer owes the **lowest** `mf` among the listed methods their mint supports. `amountToSend` computes the total for you: pass the methods your mint supports as the second argument.

`amountToSend` returns an `Amount`, so it flows straight into `wallet.ops.send` (which accepts any `AmountLike`). Convert only at the edge, for display or serialization.

```typescript
// list = [in-list.mint], bolt11 carries no fee, bolt12 carries mf=5
pr.amountToSend('https://in-list.mint', ['bolt12']); // listed mint, no fee  → 100
pr.amountToSend('https://other.mint', ['bolt11', 'bolt12']); // lowest = 0   → 100
pr.amountToSend('https://other.mint', ['bolt12']); // + mf                   → 105

const total = pr.amountToSend(myMint, myMintMethods);
await wallet.ops.send(total, proofs).run(); // Amount passed straight through
```

`amountToSend` only prices the fee that applies; it does not reject a mint or method that is not allowed (that is the caller's decision, see above). It throws if the request has no amount.

For an **amountless** request (the payer chooses the amount), use `feesFor` to price the surcharge alone and add it to the chosen amount:

```typescript
const total = chosenAmount.add(pr.feesFor(myMint, ['bolt12'])); // mf, or 0 if none applies
```

If the request sets `netFees` (`nf`), the requested amount is **net of input fees**: the receiver must be able to swap or melt the proofs without dipping below it. Select proofs with fees included:

```typescript
const builder = wallet.ops.send(total, proofs);
if (pr.netFees) builder.includeFees(true); // sender covers the receiver's input fee
await builder.run();
```

## Locked requests

A request may require the token be locked to a spending condition (P2PK / HTLC). `toP2PKOptions()` converts that condition into the options accepted by the P2PK builder, so you can produce proofs locked exactly as the receiver asked:

```typescript
const opts = pr.toP2PKOptions(); // undefined = no lockable nut10 condition
const builder = wallet.ops.send(pr.amountToSend(myMint), proofs);
// Lock only when the request asks for it; otherwise send unlocked.
if (opts) builder.asP2PK(opts);
const { keep, send } = await builder.run();
```

See [Create P2PK](./create_p2pk.md) for the builder.

## Create and encode a request (receiver side)

The `PaymentRequest` constructor takes an options object whose keys mirror the class properties; set only what you need. `amount` and each method `fee` accept any `AmountLike` (number, bigint, string, or `Amount`).

```typescript
import { PaymentRequest, PaymentRequestTransportType } from '@cashu/cashu-ts';

const request = new PaymentRequest({
  transport: [{ type: PaymentRequestTransportType.POST, target: 'https://pay.example.com' }],
  id: 'inv-123',
  amount: 100,
  unit: 'sat',
  mints: ['https://my.mint'],
  description: 'Coffee',
  mintsPreferred: true, // advisory list
  netFees: true, // amount is net of input fees
  supportedMethods: [{ method: 'bolt11' }, { method: 'bolt12', fee: 5 }],
});

request.toEncodedCreqA(); // 'creqA…'  (CBOR)
request.toEncodedCreqB(); // 'CREQB1…' (TLV + Bech32m, best for QR)
```

## Delivering the payment (sender side)

Send the receiver a `PaymentRequestPayload` over the request's transport (HTTP POST body, Nostr DM, or in-band if no transport is given):

```typescript
import type { PaymentRequestPayload } from '@cashu/cashu-ts';

const payload: PaymentRequestPayload = {
  id: pr.id,
  mint: myMint,
  unit: pr.unit ?? myUnit, // the requested unit, or the unit of what you send
  proofs: send, // the locked/selected proofs
};
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The receiver validates the incoming proofs themselves (DLEQ, and that any timelock is long enough) before accepting. Building a payload does not settle the payment.
