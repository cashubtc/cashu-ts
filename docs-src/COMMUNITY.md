# Community Contribution Philosophy

We welcome new contributors.

Many open source journeys begin with curiosity, a small improvement idea, or an AI assistant helping prototype a change. We are supportive of that energy.

At the same time, we are building a long-term ecosystem. Sustainability, alignment, and code quality matter just as much as velocity.

This document explains how to turn a first contribution into lasting impact.

---

# Our Goal

Turn this:

> Random idea → random PR

Into this:

> Curious builder → aligned contributor → long-term collaborator

Code is abundant.
Attention and alignment are scarce.

We optimize for signal, clarity, and sustainability.

# How to Get Involved

Open source can feel opaque from the outside.

If you're new to this project — or to open source in general:

- Join our weekly community call. Listening is fine.
- Introduce yourself.
- Join our Matrix channel for discussion.
- Ask questions publicly.
- Comment on issues, even if you’re unsure.

There are no hidden rules here. If something feels unclear, ask.

We are building in the open.

# First Contributions

If you’re new here, we recommend starting with:

- Issues labeled `good first issue`
- Documentation improvements
- Expanding test coverage
- Clearly scoped bug fixes

For non-trivial features or architectural changes:

1. Open an issue first.
2. Explain the problem you’re solving.
3. Propose an approach.
4. Get feedback before implementing.

Early discussion dramatically increases the likelihood your work will be merged.

# Review Expectations

Open source has longer feedback loops than internal teams.

We are an active project and we review frequently, but maintainers have other responsibilities. You should expect:

- Reviews to take several days, sometimes longer.
- Follow-up discussion and iteration.
- Requests for changes before merging.

If a PR has not received attention after a reasonable amount of time, a polite comment is welcome.

Please avoid opening multiple PRs to get attention faster. Focused, well-explained contributions get reviewed sooner.

# What Makes a Strong PR

A strong contribution:

- Solves a real and clearly described problem
- Aligns with project direction
- Follows existing patterns and architecture
- Includes appropriate tests
- Explains reasoning and trade-offs
- Keeps scope tightly focused

A good PR reduces cognitive load for reviewers.

# AI-Assisted Development

We are supportive of AI-assisted development. This document itself was written with AI assistance.

Many contributors — including maintainers — use AI tools as part of their workflow. We see AI as a normal part of modern software development.

AI is a tool. Responsibility remains human.

You must understand the code you submit, be able to explain your design decisions, and ensure correctness, performance, and licensing compliance.

AI should raise quality, not just increase output.

---

# Align Before You Build

Large or surprising PRs are harder to merge than discussed ones.

Before introducing:

- New abstractions
- New dependencies
- Major refactors
- Significant feature additions

Open an issue and discuss the approach.

Alignment saves time on both sides.

---

# Scope Discipline

To protect review bandwidth:

- One PR = one issue/topic.
- Do not bundle unrelated changes.
- Avoid opening large batches of small PRs.
- Very large PRs require prior discussion.

For new contributors, we recommend having one open PR at a time until your first contribution is merged.

This helps maintain focus and ensures meaningful feedback.

---

# Project Direction

Every project has boundaries.

We may decline contributions that:

- Expand scope beyond core goals
- Add long-term maintenance burden
- Introduce complexity without clear benefit
- Conflict with roadmap priorities

This is about sustainability, not gatekeeping.

---

# Contributions Beyond Code

We value:

- Reviewing other PRs
- Participating in issue discussions
- Improving documentation
- Writing examples
- Helping newcomers

Community health is as important as merged code.

---

# Growing With the Project

As trust builds, so does responsibility.

Contributors naturally grow from:

- First-time contributor
- Regular contributor
- Trusted contributor

Over time:

- Larger changes require less pre-alignment.
- Reviews become collaborative.
- You help shape direction.

Open source is a relationship, not a transaction.

---

# Final Thought

AI makes writing code easier.

Building a healthy ecosystem still requires:

- Judgment
- Communication
- Alignment
- Patience

If you are here to build something meaningful, participate in the conversation, and grow with the community, we are excited to work with you.
