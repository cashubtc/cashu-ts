## What's new: BLS12-381 v3 keysets

v5 introduces support for **v3 keysets**, identified by a `02` prefix on the keyset id. v3 keysets use BLS12-381 instead of secp256k1 for the BDHKE blinding curve, with multiplicative blinding and pairing-based verification replacing DLEQ. Wire-compatible with Nutshell PR #999.

Existing v0 (legacy base64), v1 (`00…`), and v2 (`01…`) keysets continue to work unchanged. The breaking change below was prompted by adding v3 support but is independent of which curve you target.

## `checkProofsStates` now requires `id` on every proof

`Wallet.checkProofsStates` previously accepted `Array<Pick<Proof, 'secret'>>` — only `secret` was required. v5 requires both `id` and `secret`: `Array<Pick<Proof, 'secret' | 'id'>>`.

The `id` selects the hash-to-curve variant used to compute the NUT-07 lookup point `Y` — secp256k1 for v0/v1/v2 keysets, BLS12-381 G1 for v3 (`02…`). Without it, v3 proofs silently miscompute `Y` and the state check returns nothing.

### Migration

```ts
// Before
await wallet.checkProofsStates([{ secret: '…' }]);

// After
await wallet.checkProofsStates([{ id: '00bd033559de27d0', secret: '…' }]);
```

If you were already passing full `Proof` objects (the normal case — `wallet.checkProofsStates(proofs)` where `proofs: Proof[]`), no change is required.
